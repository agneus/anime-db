# anime-db
A web app made using React where I used Jikan API to search and asynchronously fetch anime information, links and images from MyAnimeList and renders those in Cards. This app fetches and renders top anime from MyAnimeList using the Jikan API when the search string is empty, implemented with useEffect.
